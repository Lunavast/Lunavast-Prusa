Durbie is a 3D printer capable of printing real-life objects out of plastic. It is derived from the RepRap Prusa Mendel, with some modifications as below:

- uses a single motor for the Z axis (with the addition of a continous Z belt)

- slide coupling design allows use of slightly bent Z axis threaded rods - compensates wobbling
