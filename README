Durbie is a 3D printer capable of printing real-life objects out of plastic. It is derived from the RepRap Prusa Mendel, with some modifications as below:

- uses a single motor for the Z axis (with the addition of a continous Z belt)

- slide coupling design allows use of slightly bent Z axis threaded rods - compensates wobbling

- This file contains all the unique RP parts that differ from the legacy design (Prusa Mendel). Be sure to refer to the Durbie's BOM list as the quantities for the unchanged RP parts are different from that in the Prusa's BOM.
